We pivoted from the earlier idea of create an automated scheduling be without proper data it was more of a rule based system and would not effectively capture the current status of Machine learning.

The Giraffe System offers a targeted and personalized touch. Additionally, the daily engagement is supported by research to be efficient for mastery.
